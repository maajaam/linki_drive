# What's a linki?

Linki is an open format that specifies the size, shape and position of NFC tag to be usable across different media player usage. It is inspired by 3.5" floppy discs that have a great phsyical properties to fit nice art work and still be portable. Main idea is to create common format for internet based media that is usable on any NFC reader (like smartphones). Linki format specifies that the link to media must be in NDEF fields. Linki is a nice physical object for an URL.

Artist Timo Toots created the format after designing a museum exhibit based on floppy discs. It has been used for media player purposes in his home since 2017. The project is opening this idea up for anybody interested.
